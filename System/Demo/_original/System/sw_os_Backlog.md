## High Priority (Score: 85+)

### 1. Auto-link related tasks ⭐ 92/100
**Status:** Not started  
**Captured:** 2026-01-18

**The idea:**
When I create a task about a person or project, automatically suggest linking it to that person's page or project file. E.g., "Schedule interview with Sarah" → prompt to add to Sarah_Chen.md

**Why now:**
- **Impact (35%):** 32/35 - Reduces manual linking, surfaces tasks in context
- **Alignment (20%):** 19/20 - Matches my workflow (lots of person/project tasks)
- **Token Efficiency (20%):** 18/20 - Less searching for related tasks later
- **Memory (15%):** 14/15 - Better task-context connections over time
- **Proactivity (10%):** 9/10 - sw_os suggests connections I might miss

**Implementation approach:**
- Parse task content for names, project keywords
- Check People/ and Projects/ folders for matches
- Prompt: "This task mentions Sarah Chen. Add to her person page?"
- Update both locations (Tasks.md + person page)

**Effort:** Medium - Entity detection + file updates

### 3. Weekly pattern detection ⭐ 87/100
**Status:** Not started  
**Captured:** 2026-01-22

**The idea:**
During weekly review, sw_os analyzes the week's meetings, tasks, and journal entries to detect patterns. E.g., "You had 3 meetings with Sales this week (unusual). Energy dips every afternoon at 3pm. Mobile launch mentioned in 8 different contexts."

**Why now:**
- **Impact (35%):** 30/35 - Self-awareness drives improvement

- **Proactivity (10%):** 9/10 - Surfaces insights I'd miss

**Implementation approach:**
- During /week-review, scan last 7 days
- Count: meeting types, people interactions, energy mentions, recurring topics
- Prompt: "Patterns this week: X meetings with Y, energy low at Z, mobile launch in 8 contexts"
- Suggest learnings to capture

**Effort:** Medium-High - Pattern detection across multiple files

### 4. Task dependency suggestions 📊 78/100
**Status:** Not started  
**Captured:** 2026-01-23

**The idea:**
When creating tasks, sw_os analyzes existing tasks and suggests dependencies. E.g., "Schedule user interviews" might depend on "Finalize interview script" being completed.

**Why now:**
- **Impact (35%):** 27/35 - Better task sequencing, fewer blockers
- **Alignment (20%):** 16/20 - I often work on tasks in wrong order

- **Proactivity (10%):** 8/10 - Suggests connections proactively

**Implementation approach:**
- When creating task, check for potential blockers in backlog
- Use keywords + project context to suggest dependencies
- Prompt: "This task might depend on [other task]. Mark as blocked-by?"
- Use Work MCP to create dependency link

**Effort:** High - Dependency analysis is complex

### 5. Quarterly goals dashboard 📊 75/100
**Status:** Not started  
**Captured:** 2026-01-15

- **Memory (15%):** 12/15 - Tracks progress over time
- **Proactivity (10%):** 7/10 - Shows goal status automatically

**Implementation approach:**
- Read Quarter_Goals.md for current goals
- Count tasks tagged with quarter goals
- Check Career evidence with goal tags
- Generate dashboard: Goal → Progress → Status → Evidence count
- Flag goals falling behind

**Effort:** Medium - Aggregation across multiple sources

### 6. Smart meeting prep template 📊 73/100
**Status:** Not started  
**Captured:** 2026-01-20

**The idea:**
Instead of generic meeting prep, sw_os customizes the template based on meeting type. 1:1s show different context than customer calls. Sales calls surface deal info, design reviews show project context.

**Why now:**
- **Impact (35%):** 25/35 - More relevant context for each meeting type
- **Alignment (20%):** 15/20 - I do lots of meeting prep
- **Token Efficiency (20%):** 14/20 - Right context without manual search
- **Memory (15%):** 11/15 - Learns what context matters per type
- **Proactivity (10%):** 8/10 - Auto-customizes based on meeting

**Implementation approach:**
- Detect meeting type from title/attendees (1:1, customer, design review, etc.)
- Load type-specific template
- Populate with relevant context (person pages for 1:1s, project for design reviews)
- Generate customized prep doc

**Effort:** Medium-High - Meeting type detection + template system

- **Alignment (20%):** 14/20 - Some capture from email, not huge
- **Token Efficiency (20%):** 14/20 - Saves copy-paste time
- **Memory (15%):** 10/15 - Task context preserved from email
- **Proactivity (10%):** 8/10 - Auto-extraction of action items

**Why now:**
- **Impact (35%):** 24/35 - Easier evidence tracking for promotion
- **Alignment (20%):** 14/20 - I'm focusing on L5 progression
- **Token Efficiency (20%):** 13/20 - Saves manual tagging
- **Memory (15%):** 10/15 - Builds career evidence library
- **Proactivity (10%):** 8/10 - Suggests tags I'd miss

**Implementation approach:**
- When task completed or achievement captured, analyze content

**Why now:**
- **Impact (35%):** 20/35 - Faster capture while walking, but not huge workflow change
- **Alignment (20%):** 12/20 - I mostly type, not voice
- **Token Efficiency (20%):** 12/20 - Saves typing time

## Ideas for Future Consideration

### Rejected/Deferred

#### Calendar-task sync
**Status:** Rejected  
**Reason:** Cursor/Claude can't access calendar APIs directly. Would require external integration that's not feasible within Cursor constraints.
